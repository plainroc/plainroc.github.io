================

Clone code from hueidou.github.io. Below are changes:

- Remove Google AD from _layouts/post.html
- Comment out disqus related code from _layouts/post.html temporarily. If needed, it's possible to be modified and reused again later.
- Remove CNAME. I don't know what's it for right now, so remove to avoid conflict with hueidou.github.io
- Remove file favicon.ico. It seems not come from github.com/mojombo
- Remove "Open Source Projects" section from index.html. Right now I don't want to maintain this section.
- Remove file tags.html. I don't know what's it for and how to use it.
- Remove _includes folder. I don't know what it's for.
- Change README.md
